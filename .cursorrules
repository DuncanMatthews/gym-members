### Devias Template
This workspace contains:
- the repo that I'm building in (gym-management-main)
- a repo that I'm building from: nextjs-template-typescript

nextjs-template-typescript is a template made by Devias Kit Pro. I will bring elements in from their repo to mine. So be aware of that, and consider recommending bringing elements in from there as well, and following their coding style and structure.
